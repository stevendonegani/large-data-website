  <p>The first step in managing life-threatening allergies is to always avoid your allergens. But that’s not always possible. That’s why it’s important to always carry an EpiPen Auto-Injector just in case a reaction becomes life-threatening.
 <br><br>
 
The following is a step-by-step process in which you should administer an EpiPen:

<ol>
<h2>1. Prepare the EpiPen or EpiPen Jr Auto-Injector for Injection</h2>

	<li>Remove the auto-injector from the clear carrier tube. Flip open the yellow cap of your EpiPen or the green cap of your EpiPen Jr Auto-Injector carrier tube. Tip and slide the auto-injector out of the carrier tube.</li>
	<li>Grasp the auto-injector in your fist with the orange tip pointing downward.</li>
<li>With your other hand, remove the blue safety release by pulling straight up without bending or twisting it.</li>
<i>Note: The needle comes out of the orange tip.</i>
<li>Never put your thumb, fingers or hand over the orange tip.</li>
</ol>
