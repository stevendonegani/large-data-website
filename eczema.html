Eczema is a group of skin conditions that cause inflammation of the skin. Eczema is not caused by an infection. The condition may be temporary or chronic, mild or, in rare instances, very serious.<br><br>

Serious cases usually occur when:
<ul>
	<li>it is severe enough to cause complications, such as skin infections.</li>
	
	<li>an affected person also contracts the <i>herpes simplex</i> virus. </li>
	
	<li>an affected person has a violent allergic reaction caused by <i>contact dermatitis</i></li>

</ul>

<b>Atopic dermatitis</b> is the prevalent form of chronic eczema. It is a genetically inherited condition that tends to run in families who also suffer from hay fever and asthma. Atopic dermatitis will affect about 10% to 20% of people at some point in their lives.<br><br>

<b>Dyshidrotic eczema</b> occurs on the palms of the hands, sides of the fingers, and the soles of the feet, and it is associated with itching and blisters.<br><br>
<b>Nummular dermatitis</b> is a type of eczema that normally affects older adults. Round patches of scaly, inflamed skin may appear anywhere on the body, most commonly on the legs. Winter is the peak period for this condition. It tends to strike dry skin.<br><br>

<b>Stasis dermatitis</b> (or gravitational eczema) affects the lower legs of older adults. It is basically a poor circulation problem, usually due to blood not being able to get out of the legs well. It is caused by varicose veins.

	<li><h3>Hands</h3></li> Teach all members of your household to wash their hands before touching the non-allergenic foods – even if they are touching it in order to serve themselves. For example, your non-allergic daughter should not stick her possibly allergen-covered hand into the box of crackers or bag of chips that are meant to be safe for her allergic sibling.


	<li><h3>Utensils</h3></li>
		Do not allow allergen-covered utensils to contaminate your "safe" foods. For example, if a knife containing butter has been inserted into a jar of jam, the jam is no longer safe for a dairy-allergic individual to eat. If a knife is used to spread some butter on a piece of wheat bread toast, and the stick of butter is then touched by this now bread crumb-covered knife, the butter will be cross-contaminated with wheat (and all of the other ingredients contained in the bread).</li>
	<li><h3>Avoid Getting Allergenic Residue All Over the House</h3></li>
		If you allow allergenic food in your home, you need to take precautions to ensure that your entire home does not become contaminated with allergenic food residue. Teach all members of your household to always wash their hands with soap immediately after eating or touching something allergenic. In addition, consider confining all food consumption to your kitchen and dining areas. Remember, if Dad eats dinner on the sofa and Sister walks around the house eating snacks, crumbs and other residue are likely to find their way onto your carpets, furniture, counter-tops, toys, and other surfaces.

</ul>

<h2>Don't Forget Your Guests</h2>
When friends who have been eating allergenic foods just prior to visiting your home arrive, politely ask them (and their children!!) to wash their hands before they touch anything. If your friends have infants, you may need to take precautions to avoid allowing these infants to spit up on your carpets or furniture, especially if your food-allergic child tends to put her hands or fingers into her mouth. The food, formula, or breast milk that your friends’ babies spit up is likely to be allergenic, and will therefore "contaminate" the surfaces on which it lands. Because your goal is to make your home a safe haven for your child, be sure that your friends’ babies are set down on a clean blanket or other appropriate carpet or furniture protector.

<h2>Take Precautions When Cooking</h2>
Take steps to ensure that you do not contaminate your child’s food with allergens during the cooking or serving process:

<ul>	<li>If you are preparing both allergenic and non-allergenic food for the same meal (such as sandwiches with or without mayonnaise and cheese), prepare the non-allergenic meal first – before you even open the allergenic ingredients.</li>

		<li>Do not use the same utensils to simultaneously prepare allergenic and non-allergenic dishes.</li>

		<li>Place all allergen-contaminated utensils, plates, cutting boards, etc. directly into the sink or the dishwasher immediately after use. Teach all members of your household that soiled items in the sink or dishwasher are not to be used again until they have been properly washed.</li>

		<li>If you use your barbecue to cook both allergenic and non-allergenic foods, be sure to thoroughly clean the grill before cooking for your food-allergic child.</li>
		</ul>
<h2>Wash Dishes Thoroughly</h2>

Mixing bowls, pots, pans, utensils, and so forth that have been used in the preparation of allergenic foods must be thoroughly washed in hot, sudsy water prior to being used to prepare food for your allergic child. In addition, to avoid having stray bits of dried allergenic food stick to your "clean" dishes, it is best to rinse off dirty dishes and utensils that are "contaminated" with allergenic foods prior to loading them into your dishwasher.
