<h3>Hay Fever</h3>
Hay fever is an immune disorder characterized by an allergic response to pollen grains and other substances. Also known as allergic rhinitis, there are two types: seasonal, which occurs only during the time of year in which certain plants pollinate, and perennial, which occurs all year round.

<h3>Allergic Conjunctivitis (Pink Eye)</h3>
Pink eye caused by bacteria, viruses, or STDs can spread easily from person to person but is not a serious health risk if diagnosed promptly; allergic conjunctivitis is not contagious.

<h3>Hives (Urticaria)</h3>
Hives, also known as urticaria, are an outbreak of swollen, pale red bumps, patches, or welts on the skin that appear suddenly -- either as a result of allergies, or for other reasons.

<h3>Allergies to Poison Ivy, Oak, and Sumac</h3>
Poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac are plants that contain an irritating, oily sap called urushiol. Urushiol triggers an allergic reaction when it comes into contact with skin, resulting in an itchy rash, which can appear within hours of exposure or up to several days later.

<h3>Allergies to Insect Stings (Bee Stings)</h3>
Bee, wasp, yellow jacket, hornet, or fire ant stings are the insect stings that most often trigger allergies. However, most people are not allergic to insect stings and may mistake a normal sting reaction for an allergic reaction.

<h3>Mold Allergy</h3>
People with mold allergies, however, may have a reaction if exposed to too much of the fungus.

<h3>Pollen Allergies</h3>
For most people, a change of seasons signals the beginning of long, lazy days or cool, crisp evenings. But for the one in 10 Americans who suffers from pollen allergies, changing seasons can mean misery.

<h3>Sun Reactions of the Skin</h3>
Most people's skin will burn if there is enough exposure to ultraviolet radiation. However, some people burn particularly easily or develop exaggerated skin reactions to sunlight.

<h3>Aspirin Allergy (Salicylate Allergy)</h3>
Salicylates are chemicals found naturally in plants and are a major ingredient of aspirin and other pain-relieving medications. They are also found in many fruits and vegetables as well as in many common health and beauty products.

<h3>Cosmetic Allergy</h3>
Although cosmetics can help us feel more beautiful, they can cause skin irritation or allergic reactions. Certain ingredients used in cosmetics, such as fragrances and preservatives, can act as allergens, substances that trigger an allergic reaction.

<h3>Nickel Allergy</h3>
A nickel allergy is a skin reaction that develops after exposure to nickel or items containing the metal.

<h3>Drug Allergy</h3>
Many drugs can cause adverse side effects, and certain medicines can trigger allergic reactions. In an allergic reaction, the immune system mistakenly responds to a drug by creating an immune response against it.

<h3>Dust Allergy</h3>
Life with dust allergies -- whether they're yours or a family member's -- comes with a load of questions. For instance, might a dust allergy explain your child's never-ending cold symptoms?

<h3>Chemical Allergy</h3>
They promise to make your skin soft, your hair shiny, and your laundry springtime fresh, but for some people the chemicals in shampoos, cosmetics, and detergents trigger allergic skin reactions.

<h3>Penicillin Allergy</h3>
A penicillin allergy is an allergic reaction that occurs when your body's immune system overreacts to penicillin antibiotics.A penicillin allergy is an allergic reaction that occurs when your body's immune system overreacts to penicillin antibiotics.<br><br>
