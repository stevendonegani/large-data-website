  <h3>Spring Allergies</h3>
Spring is the time of year that we normally think of when it comes to seasonal allergies. As the trees start to bloom and the pollen gets airborne, allergy sufferers begin their annual ritual of sniffling and sneezing.

<h3>Summer Allergies</h3>
Although spring most readily comes to mind when we think of allergies, many of the same allergic triggers that can make us miserable in the spring persist into summer.

<h3>Fall Allergies</h3>
The allergy triggers might be slightly different, but they can be just as misery-inducing as the flower pollen that fills the air in the spring and summer.

<h3>Winter Allergies</h3>
<p>When it gets cold and your furnace kicks on, it sends dust, mold spores, and insect parts into the air. They can get into your nose and can trigger a reaction.<br><br>

If you have pollen allergies, you may get a break when the weather gets cold. But if you have indoor allergies -- such as mold and dust mites -- spending more time indoors during the winter months may affect your allergy symptoms.
