<b>Allergic shock</b> <i>(anaphylaxis)</i> is a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction that can affect a number of organs at the same time. Allergens that typically lead to anaphylaxis are foods, medications, and venom (bee stings). Aeroallergens rarely lead to anaphylaxis.<br><br>

 Some or all of the following symptoms may occur:
<ul>
<li>Hives</li>
<li>Nasal congestion, runny nose, itchy eyes</li>
<li>Swelling of the tongue and/or throat</li>
<li>Abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea</li>
<li>Shortness of breath, wheezing, coughing</li>
<li>Low blood pressure leading to lightheadedness, passing out, or shock</li>
</ul>

<br><br>

<b>Anaphylactic shock</b> occurs when blood vessels enlarge excessively due to an allergic reaction, which causes a significant drop in blood pressure. This can result in inadequate blood flow to the organs in the body and is an emergent, life-threatening condition.
