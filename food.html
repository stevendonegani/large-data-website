  <p><b>Food Allergies</b> and <b>Food Intolerance</b>
affect nearly everyone at some point. People often have an unpleasant reaction to something they ate and wonder if they have a food allergy.<br><br>

<h3>Milk Allergy</h3>
If you suffer from a milk allergy, strictly avoiding milk and food containing milk and milk products is the only way to prevent a reaction, which can include immediate wheezing, vomiting, and hives.

<h3>Egg Allergy</h3>
Egg allergies -- especially to egg whites -- are more common in children than in adults and reactions range from mild to severe.

<h3>Wheat Allergy</h3>
If you are allergic to any wheat protein strictly avoiding wheat and wheat products is the only way to prevent a reaction, which can include stomach upset, eczema, allergic rhinitis, bronchospasm (asthma-like symptoms) and even anaphylaxis.

</p>Nut (Peanut) Allergy</h3>
If you suffer from a nut allergy, strictly avoiding nuts, including peanuts and tree nuts like cashews and walnuts, and food containing nuts is the only way to prevent a reaction.<br><br>

If you are allergic to peanuts, you may need to avoid tree nuts like walnuts and almonds. Same goes if you’re allergic to tree nuts -- you may need to avoid peanuts. Ask your doctor to be sure. Tree nuts include:

<ul>
<li>Almonds</li>
<li>Brazil nuts</li>
<li>Cashews</li>
<li>Chestnuts</li>
<li>Filberts</li>
<li>Hazelnuts</li>
<li>Hickory nuts</li>
<li>Macadamia nuts</li>
<li>Pecans</li>
<li>Pine nuts</li>
<li>Pistachios</li>
<li>Walnuts</li></ul>


<h3>Fish Allergy</h3>
If your doctor is able to identify exactly which type of fish causes your allergies, than you only need to eliminate that species of fish from your diet. For the majority of fish allergy sufferers, this is not an option and all fish must be avoided.

<h3>Shellfish Allergy</h3>
If you are allergic to one type of shellfish, you may be allergic to others.

<h3>Sulfite Allergy</h3>
Sulfites are a group of sulfur-based compounds that may occur naturally or may be added to food as an enhancer and preservative. The FDA estimates that one out of 100 people is sensitive to the compounds.

<h3>Soy Allergy</h3>
Soy allergies start with soybeans. Soybeans are legumes. Other foods in the legume family include navy beans, kidney beans, string beans, black beans, pinto beans, chickpeas (garbanzo or chichi beans), lentils, carob, licorice, and peanuts.

<h3>Casein Allergy</h3>
If a glass of milk or a slice of pizza causes swollen lips, hives, or other significant symptoms, you may have an allergy to casein, a protein in milk.<br><br>
